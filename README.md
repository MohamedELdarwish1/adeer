**Real-time Bidding API Endpoint in Laravel - README**

### Introduction

This repository contains the implementation of an API endpoint for handling real-time bidding data securely using Laravel. The endpoint allows users to place bids on auctions in real-time.

### Endpoint Specifications

- **Route:** POST /api/register you should register first
- **Route:** POST /api/login  then you should login and 
get the token 
 -------------------------------------------------------
- **Route:** POST /api/bid
- **Description:** This endpoint is responsible for receiving real-time bidding data.
- **Request Body:**
  - `user_id`: The ID of the user making the bid.
  - `auction_id`: The ID of the auction for which the bid is being made.
  - `amount`: The bid amount.
- **Response:**
  - Success: HTTP 200 OK with a success message.
  - Failure: Appropriate HTTP status code with error message.

### Data Validation Steps

- **Input Validation:**
  - `user_id`: Required and must exist in the users table.
  - `auction_id`: Required and must exist in the auctions table.
  - `amount`: Required, numeric, and must be greater than or equal to 0.

### Security Measures

- **Authentication:** Use Laravel Sanctum to authenticate users and generate access tokens.

- **Input Sanitization:** Validate and sanitize all incoming data to prevent SQL injection attacks and other forms of malicious input.
- **HTTPS:** Use HTTPS to encrypt data transmission between the client and server to prevent data interception.

- **Error Handling:** Implement proper error handling to avoid leaking sensitive information in error responses.
- **Validation:** Utilize Laravel's validation system to validate incoming data and reject invalid requests.
